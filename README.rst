Fibernavigator
==============

The Fibernavigator is a tool designed for a fast and versatile visualization of fibers datasets.

**Welcome new users**

If you are new here and are coming after seeing the presentation in Rome, you can find 
the version containing Real-time fMRI and all the latest tools in the Releases_ page.

For other users, please note that the Fibernavigator now has a Real-time fMRI connectivity mode and
new anatomy coloring modes. The branch containing this code is rtfmri-dmri,
and is based on wxWidgets 3.0. The branch opacity-rendering has implementation of Tax et al. 2014 ISMRM abstract 
for the interactive rendering of orientation-dependent tractography.

Tutorials
---------

New **video tutorials** of the Fibernavigator are available.

- `Scene navigation`_: how to interact with the 3D view, move planes, etc.
- `Mesh display and interaction`_: how to create and modify the display of meshes.
- `Drawing tool`_: how to draw on empty or already existing anatomies.
- `Fiber navigation`_: how to interact with fibers and select a subset of them.

A list of all tutorials can be seen on the `video tutorials`_ page.

Highlights:
-----------

- Fast and efficient visualization of the results of deterministic and probabilistic tractograms.
- Interactive selection of fibers.
- Real-time fiber tractography. (Chamberland et al. 2014, Frontiers in Neuroinformatics)
- Tractography-driven resting-state fMRI
- Orientation-dependant opacity rendering (Tax et al. 2014, ISMRM)
- Display of MRI, functional MRI and EEG/MEG source localization results.

How to get the application
--------------------------

- `Build instructions for Ubuntu`_ and other Linux distros are provided
- Windows and OSX builds are available on the Releases_ page.

Development and contact with the team
-------------------------------------

- Issues can be submitted in the `issue tracker`_.
- Various development and use recommandations and how-tos are located on the wiki_.
